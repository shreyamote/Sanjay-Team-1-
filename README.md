Unlock the language of touch, and open the doors to embark on your tactile journey toward learning through innovation.

Visually impaired children often encounter significant difficulties accessing Braille educational materials, which are essential for their learning. Traditional Braille resources, such as textbooks and worksheets, may not always be readily available or adapted to their specific curriculum. As a result, visually impaired students face limitations in acquiring knowledge and engaging with educational content effectively. Digitalization is the need of time and our only motto is to provide improved digital ways for visually impaired children to learn through new, innovative, and impactful ways.

Title: Enhancing Digital Education for Visually Impaired Children through a Braille Education App

Solution Proposal:
Our solution involves creating a Braille Education App that provides visually impaired children with a comprehensive and accessible platform for learning. 
    What will our app do?
    * Voice to digital braille 
    * Digital braille to voice 
    * Images recognition using braille
    * Braille writing assessment 
    * Reading assessments.
    * Translators
